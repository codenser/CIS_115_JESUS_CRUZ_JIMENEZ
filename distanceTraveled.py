#this code uses a formula to calculate the distance traveled
#euqation: distance = velocity * time
velocity = 80
time = 2
distance = velocity * time

print(f'the calculated distance traveled is {distance} miles.')

#this next equation calculates the velocity of an object with a known distance and time

distance2= int(400)
time2= int(4)

velocity2= distance2/ time2
print(f'The velocity of the object is {velocity2} miles per hour.')
